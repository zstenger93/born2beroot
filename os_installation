installing the os
	in my case it is Debian 11 Bullseye

have in mind if bonus will be handled or not because the setup need to be done in that manner
structure matters!


setup the folder to install to
attach the actual ISO file later and start the VM for install

install
	choose the right settings
		setup hostname and password
		username
		password
	partitioning method!
		manual
			SCSI1 (0,0,0)
